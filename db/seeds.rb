# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Category.create(name: 'Classical')
# Category.create(name: 'Drama')
# Category.create(name: 'Comedy')
# Category.create(name: 'Action')

# Delete multiple rows
# Category.destroy([5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15])
# Category.delete([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16])

# Delete a single row
# Category.destroy(4)
